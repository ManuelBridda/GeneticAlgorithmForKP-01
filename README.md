# GeneticAlgorithmForKP-01
This is a java-based project developed for the course "Fundaments of Artificial Intelligence" at university of Bologna.
This project aims to resolve the Knapsack Problem 0-1 with Genetic Algorithms.
First of all a class Chromosome, is created to host the genes of each chromosome. The Chromosome just have an array of integers which will store 0 and 1 . Then methods to create and print a population of N chromosome and are added. After this a method to randomly edit each chromosome for being feasibible to our problem is added.
